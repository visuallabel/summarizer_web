Rename the build.properties.orig to build.properties. Modify build.properties to match your installation details. All required .jar files
are in the lib directory.

Importing the source code as existing ant project to eclipse will probably not
work. It is better to create a new java project and select the project directory
to be the source code location (summarizer_web), and set the required build path
variables manually.

Installation to server:
- Any relatively new Apache Tomcat (tested on Tomcat 7, other servlet containers may also work) should work.
- For tomcat, the administration user (in tomcat-user.xml) requires the permission: manager-script when deployment using Ant is used. 
- Java 7 is required (tested on Oracle's implementation, but might work with e.g. OpenJDK7).
- The ant build script should create a working .war file automatically, which can be deployed to the servler container.
- You must manually create the summarizer output directory as set in the summarizer.properties file 
 (in classes directory of sources or in WEB_INF of deployed webapp), this is used for storing temporary data, so it must also
 have the required write/read permissions.
